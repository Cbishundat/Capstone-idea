# Project ideas for Capstone

*  A media recommendation web app that would recommend movies, shows, anime, etc. based on user preferences/interests and past viewing history. 

*  A food recommendation web app that would suggest foods and/or recipes depending on whatever ingredients the user inputs. 

*  A sales tracker web app that would allow the user to input an item they're interested in and they would be able to see the best price for that item accross various online store platforms.

Technologies: Javascript framework like React + HTML/CSS for frontend, hosting on a node.js server with Express and usage of APIs or web scraping tools for information gathering on the backend.
